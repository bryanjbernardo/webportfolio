Since a few years ago, I've been getting the occasional nudge from my friend (ComSci graduate) to try having a career in the IT industry due to my logic-driven personality and problem-solving abilities.
I grew up being known to my close friends and family as the "techy" one, since I have continuously followed trends in modern technology, mainly in consumer-tech.
Only now that I got introduced to Zuitt have I realized that pursuing an IT career can be a possibility for me as well.
Besides my curiosity about this industry, I am also interested in learning how the internet and websites work behind the scenes. We know that the internet is a necessity in our society, and I would like to be a part of an industry that's ever-evolving and practically limitless.

With a diverse background spanning manufacturing, music production, and customer support, I've contributed across roles, from coordinating live performances and educating in music theory as a Band Leader, to managing inventory and customer orders as a Barista. My experience extends to freelance roles in music production and food delivery, where I've ensured quality in musical arrangement/recording and maintained food order integrity during deliveries. Additionally, in my current position as a Part-time Support Associate in RareJob Philippines, I excel in facilitating lesson reminders and schedule requests, resolving email inquiries, and assisting with our clients' urgent concerns via live chat, ensuring accuracy and efficiency across various tasks.
