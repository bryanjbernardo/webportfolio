Since a few years ago, I've been getting the occasional nudge from my friend (ComSci graduate) to try having a career in the IT industry due to my logic-driven personality and problem-solving abilities.Â 
I grew up being known to my close friends and family as the "techy" one, since I have continuously followed trends in modern technology, mainly in consumer tech.
Only now that I got introduced to Zuitt have I realized that pursuing an IT career can be a possibility for me as well.
Besides my curiosity about this industry, I am also interested in learning how the internet and websites work behind the scenes. We know that the internet is a necessity in our society, and I would like to be a part of an industry that's ever-evolving and practically limitless.
